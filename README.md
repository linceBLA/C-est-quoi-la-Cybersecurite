# C-est-quoi-la-Cybersecurite

## Audience

I had the opportunity to present to primary school students in 3rd to 5th grades about cybersecurity. While these young students are just beginning to encounter digital risks, I believe it is essential to introduce them to cybersecurity concepts at an early age. Understanding these principles from a young age is crucial, as cybersecurity will become increasingly important for their generation, equipping them with the knowledge needed to navigate the digital world safely and responsibly.

## Purpose

In my presentation, I aimed to introduce them to the basics of the internet and cybersecurity.

Understanding the Internet
I began by explaining the fundamentals of the internet, describing how it connects people and devices globally. I introduced key vocabulary related to the digital world, such as "website," "browser," and "software," to help the students grasp essential concepts.

What is a Cyberattack?
Next, I explained what a cyberattack is and how it can impact individuals and organizations. I simplified the concept by describing different types of attacks, such as phishing and malware, in a way that was easy for the students to understand. I also warned them about the potential risks of social media, including the importance of being careful about what they share and who they interact with online.

Protecting Themselves Online
To empower the students to stay safe online, I provided practical tips on good online habits. I emphasized the importance of creating strong, unique passwords and being cautious with links and messages from unknown sources. I also stressed the importance of not sharing personal information online.

Building Good Online Habits
By teaching them these fundamental concepts and safety practices, I aimed to build a strong foundation for their understanding of cybersecurity. My goal was to encourage responsible online behavior and help them navigate the digital world safely from an early age.
