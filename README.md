# C-est-quoi-la-Cybersecurite

## Audience

I had the opportunity to present to primary school students in 3rd to 5th grades about cybersecurity. While these young students are just beginning to encounter digital risks, I believe it is essential to introduce them to cybersecurity concepts at an early age. Understanding these principles from a young age is crucial, as cybersecurity will become increasingly important for their generation, equipping them with the knowledge needed to navigate the digital world safely and responsibly.
